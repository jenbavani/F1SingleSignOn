SINGLE SIGN ON USING FELLOWSHIP ONE API

By @TracyMazelin with thanks to @ChrisVaughn for his contributions


This script allows Churches who use the Fellowship One Church Management System to authenticate their website users against the weblink and/or infellowship username and password credentials.

It is designed to be used on a church website to allow congregants to login to a private member area of the website without the church having to separately store the credentials.  
 
Usernames and passwords are authenticated via the API and data points are retrieved back for use within the church site.

These fields include:

firstName
lastName
personID
etc

For more information and instrutions on use, see:
