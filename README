SINGLE SIGN ON USING FELLOWSHIP ONE API

By @TracyMazelin with thanks to @ChrisVaughn for his contributions


This script allows Churches who use the Fellowship One Church Management System to authenticate their website users against the weblink and/or infellowship username and password credentials.

It is designed to be used on a church website to allow a single sign on solution to each of the Fellowship One weblink modules.

Usernames and passwords are authenticated via the API and data points are retrived back for use within the church site.

These fields include:

firstName
lastName
personID
iCode

The iCode can be concatenated to the weblink url to provide seemless access to online giving, profile editing, event registrations, and volunteer management.
